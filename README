This program scans for QAM channels using a HDHomerun-Cable Card device to
generate a channels.conf formatted file.  It can then be imported into
various programs.

The end result is that users with a cable card can create a file that
includes the call sign of the station on a particular QAM frequency, making
it easier to share that information with users that don't have a cable card.

Requirements:
You'll need to install XMLTV and run tv_grab_na_dd --configure first.  This
will pull down a channel map for your account from Schedules Direct.

You need to install libfile-homedir-perl in order to run the script:
$ sudo apt-get install libfile-homedir-perl

if you're on Ubuntu.

For best results, you'll need at least one Cable Card HDHR and one non-CC
HDHR.  The scanner will abort if it doesn't find a CC HDHR, because that's
the whole point.
