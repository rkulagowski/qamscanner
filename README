This program scans for QAM channels using a HDHomerun-Cable Card to generate
a channels.conf formatted file.  It can then be imported into various
programs.

The end result is that users with a cable card can create a file that
includes the call sign of the station on a particular QAM frequency, making
it easier to share that information with users that don't have a cable card.
