This program scans for clear QAM channels using a HDHomerun-Cable Card
device to generate a file containg the names and callsigns of the channels
which were discovered.

The end result is that users with a cable card can create a file that
includes the call sign of the station on a particular QAM frequency, making
it easier to share that information with users that don't have a cable card.

Requirements:
For best results, you'll need at least one Cable Card HDHR and one non-CC
HDHR.  The scanner will abort if it doesn't find a CC HDHR, because that's
the whole point.

Usage: qamscanner.pl [switches]

This script supports the following command line arguments.
No arguments will run a scan from channel 1 through 1000.

qamscanner.pl v3.00 2013-01-28
Usage: qamscanner.pl [switches]

This script supports the following command line arguments.
No arguments will run a scan from channel 1 through 1000.

--debug                    Enable debug mode. Prints additional information
                           to assist in troubleshooting any issues.

--start=n                  Start channel. Default is channel 1.

--end=n                    End channel. Default is channel 1000.

--verify= streaminfo | mpg Some cable providers have pseudo clear QAM channels.
                           (Primarily "On Demand") The script will try to
                           verify that the channel is actually available via
                           clear QAM by using an ATSC HDHomerun to either
                           read the encryption status directly from the QAM
                           table via streaminfo or by creating sample mpg
                           files.  Default is to use streaminfo.

--duration                 If "--verify=mpg" is used, how long a sample
                           should be captured (in seconds).  Default is 10
                           seconds.

--vlc= IP.add.re.ss        VLC can be used to confirm unknown channels. Specify
                           the IP address of the host running VLC. Default is
                           "127.0.0.1"

--authtype                 {unspecified | unknown | subscribed}
                           Unless explicitly passed, the default is
                           "unspecified".  If the scan returns no valid
                           channels, re-run this program with "--authtype
                           unknown" If you are on FIOS, you may need to use
                           "--authtype subscribed" which will automatically
                           enable --verify streaminfo

--zipcode                  When grabbing the channel list from Schedules Direct,
                           you can supply your 5-digit zip code or
                           6-character postal code to get a list of cable TV
                           providers in your area, otherwise you'll be
                           prompted.  If you're specifying a Canadian postal
                           code, then use six consecutive characters, no
                           embedded spaces.


The following should only be used once you're familiar with the program.
--ccdevice                 Specify which cable card device will be used for the
                           scan.
--cctuner                  Specify which tuner will be used on the cable
                           card HDHR. Defaults to tuner 0.

--qamdevice                Specify which non-CC device is used to confirm the
                           results of the scan.
--qamtuner                 Specify which tuner will be used on the non-CC HDHR.
                           Automatically configures that tuner for coax, so
                           ensure that it's not connected to an antenna.
                           Defaults to tuner 0.

--lineupID                 Your headend identifier.
--devtype                  Headend device type. Defaults to "blank", the
                           traditional analog lineup.

--help                     This screen.
