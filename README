This program scans for QAM channels using a HDHomerun-Cable Card device to
generate a channels.conf formatted file.  It can then be imported into
various programs.

The end result is that users with a cable card can create a file that
includes the call sign of the station on a particular QAM frequency, making
it easier to share that information with users that don't have a cable card.

Requirements:
You'll need to install XMLTV and run tv_grab_na_dd --configure first.  This
will pull down a channel map for your account from Schedules Direct.

You need to install libfile-homedir-perl in order to run the script:
$ sudo apt-get install libfile-homedir-perl

if you're on Ubuntu.

For best results, you'll need at least one Cable Card HDHR and one non-CC
HDHR.  The scanner will abort if it doesn't find a CC HDHR, because that's
the whole point.

qamscanner.pl accepts the following command line arguments.
No arguments will run a scan from channel 2 through 300.

--debug      Enable debug mode.  Prints additional information
             to assist with any issues.
--create-mpg If you have an ATSC HDHR on your network, it will
             be used to create sample .mpg files to verify channel
             information. Default is false.
--duration   If you're creating .mpg files, how long should they
             be (in seconds). Default is 10 seconds.
--start      Start channel.  Default is channel 2.
--end        End channel.  Default is channel 300.
--help       This screen.
