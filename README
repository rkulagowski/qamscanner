This program scans for QAM channels using a HDHomerun-Cable Card to generate
a channels.conf formatted file.  It can then be imported into various
programs.

The end result is that users with a cable card can create a file that
includes the call sign of the station on a particular QAM frequency, making
it easier to share that information with users that don't have a cable card.

Requirements:
You'll need to install XMLTV and run tv_grab_na_dd --configure first.  This
will pull down a channel map for your account.

For best results, you'll need at least one Cable Card HDHR and one non-CC
HDHR.  The scanner will abort if it doesn't find a CC HDHR, because that's
the whole point.

If you only have a CC HDHR, then set $create_mpg to 0.
